Following the rename of the lead image and rich text behaviors, use the new
setting of plone.behavior to register their ``former_dotted_names``, so that
consumers that have stored the old dotted name have a chance of recovering.
This is especially needed for plone.app.versioningbehavior,
see `issue <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.versioningbehavior/pull/45>`
